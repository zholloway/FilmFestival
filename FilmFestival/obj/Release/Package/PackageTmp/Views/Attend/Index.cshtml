            <h3><strong>2017 BADGES</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Fan Badge - $425.00 - </strong>
                <a href="" class="storyLink">ON SALE FEBRUARY 1, 2017! </a>
                Guarantees you a seat at all time slots during Fantastic Fest (just not necessarily your first choice film in each time slot). 
                Most films screen more than once, so you should be able to see everything you want, with the exception of the high profile opening and closing films. 
                The Fan Badges also include access to all of the Fantastic Fest parties, including the opening and closing night parties.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Half Badge - $225.00 - </strong>
                <a href="" class="storyLink">ON SALE FEBRUARY 1, 2017! </a>
                The busiest time of the festival is always the first half. 
                The majority of the filmmakers, distributors and buyers are in town for opening weekend and then leave on Monday morning or Sunday night. 
                The way the festival is programmed, we try to play almost all of the films in the first 4 days and then again in the second 4 days, so if you purchase a 2nd-half festival badge, you will still get the chance to see just about everything from the festival line-up. 
                Good for any screening Monday-Thursday. 2nd-half festival badge-holders will be seated at the same time as the regular badge holders for the second half of the fest. 
                The 2nd-half festival badge also includes access to all of the Fantastic Fest parties in the 2nd-half of the fest, including the closing night party.

                <strong>Superfan Badges -  $490.00 - SOLD OUT - </strong>
                Superfan Badges include an exclusive limited-edition t-shirt and poster, plus a souvenir Fantastic Fest shoulder bag. 
                The main benefit of the Superfan badge, however, is guaranteed admission to the movie of your choice at any given showtime. 
                Superfan Badgeholders must arrive 20 minutes before showtime or else your seats may be given up. 
                Superfan badge holders will also receive guaranteed admission to all panels and parties.
